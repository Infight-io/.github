## Hi there 👋

Infight is a game you play with your friends in Discord! It's open-source and we welcome your contributions or questions.

Infight exists across two repositories:
 - [Infight](https://github.com/Infight-io/infight) is the ExpressJS game server backend.
 - [Infight-ui](https://github.com/Infight-io/infight-ui) is the Vue.js static front-end website.

Please start by joining a game on [our official Discord](https://discord.gg/UsXX4Umj), or by [adding Infight](https://infight.io/FAQ) to your favorite Discord server!

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
